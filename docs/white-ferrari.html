          Bad luck to talk on these rides <br />
          Mind on the road, your dilated eyes watch the clouds float <br />
          White Ferrari, had a good time <br />
          (Sweet 16, how was I supposed to know anything?) <br />
          I let you out at Central <br />
          I didn’t care to state the plain <br />
          Kept my mouth closed, we’re both so familiar <br />
          White Ferrari, good times <br />
        </p>
        <p>
          Stick by me, close by me <br />
          You were fine, you were fine here <br />
          That’s just a slow body <br />
          You left when I forgot to speak <br />
          So I text the speech, lesser speeds, Texas speed, yes <br />
          Basic takes its toll on me, ’ventually, ’ventually, yes <br />
          Ahh, on me ’ventually, ’ventually, yes <br />
        </p>

        <p>
          I care for you still and I will forever <br />
          That was my part of the deal, honest <br />
          We got so familiar <br />
          Spending each day of the year <br />
          White Ferrari, good times <br />
          In this life (life), in this life (life) <br />
          One too many years <br />
          Some tattooed eyelids on a facelift <br />
          (Thought you might want to know now) <br />
          Mind over matter is magic, I do magic <br />
          If you think about it, it’ll be over in no time <br />
          And that’s life
        </p>

        <p>
          I’m sure we’re taller in another dimension <br />
          You say we’re small and not worth the mention <br />
          You’re tired of movin’, your body’s achin’ <br />
          We could vacay, there’s places to go <br />
          Clearly this isn’t all that there is <br />
          Can’t take what’s been given <br />
          But we’re so okay here, we’re doing fine <br />
          Primal and naked <br />
          You dream of walls that hold us in prison <br />
          It’s just a skull, least that’s what they call it <br />
          And we’re free to roam
