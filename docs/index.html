          This is a story of personal loss, identity, and Vietnam.
      </p>
      <p>
Long before I was born, my parents abandoned their home country, their family, and friends in hopes of a better future. A better future, not only for them but for the generation they would leave behind once they’re gone. They fled with no idea of where they would end up. All they wanted was better opportunities. Opportunities which did not exist in Vietnam. Permanence was a feeling they wouldn’t be feeling for a long time. They were without a home for years before they arrived in Sweden. 
</p>
<p>
Growing up, I never had a sense of belonging. I was not quite Swedish enough to be celebrating Christmas, not Vietnamese enough for Tet. I had to forge my own identity. In a society that’s built on a consensus culture, where what the group thinks is law, I had to find my own truth. As a kid, I never knew why I felt sad after every visit to Vietnam. What was this emptiness? Now that I am older I realize it was the people, the culture, and the love I experienced in Vietnam that always made me at ease. It felt like home.
</p>
<p>
But life happens and during my young adulthood, I didn't visit Vietnam for over ten years. However, three years ago, I returned. This time it was different. I had grown up and I had lost myself as the years had passed. I had lost the language, but more importantly, I had lost the connection to people who I once was close to. What hurt me the most was my inability to communicate with humans I cared about. 
</p>
<p>
So what do we do when our words fail us and we lose ourselves? When the very people we want close to us feel the most distant? For the last few years, I have been trying to learn more about the culture and people. To understand my relatives, to understand my parent’s history and culture, to understand myself, I needed to learn the language. Languages shape the way we think. Each language has its own worldview, built by our ancestors and those before them. When you learn a new language you give yourself the ability to look at the world through a new lens. You unravel a world which you have not yet explored. Languages construct reality, and, in turn, makes us understand the very essence of what makes us human. 
</p>
<p>
My parents fled Vietnam in hopes of a better future for their children. They understood everything that would be lost along the way: traditions would be destroyed, languages forgotten, and connections would be broken. They understood that their children would grow up having to find their own identity. Some children will find comfort in adopting the culture of their new found land. They try to find social acceptance and in the process forgo a part of themselves. A part which they never fully understood. A part of them dies. They create a new home. 

</p>
<p>
Other children, like me, feel a sense of loss and dissonance. They begin a quest to discover their heritage. They know it will be a long and difficult journey.  They know they will feel lost along the way. They will bear the weight of two worlds. There will be times where they want to give up, times where they will be asked "Where are you from?" no matter which of the two places they are in. 

</p>
<p>
What people don't realize is that a lot of children experience this struggle throughout their lives but it’s all concealed behind a veneer of honor and pride. We are told by our parents not to show our weakness. Don’t let the world know of our struggles. Bear it all by ourselves. Be invisible. Even to ourselves. That is the way we were raised. 

</p>
<p>
There are days where I don't feel like myself. Sometimes I feel lost. But I'm just a drifter that's off to see the world. In my own way. With my own story. A story I want to share to shed light on something that is not often spoken of. It’s not special. It’s just real.
