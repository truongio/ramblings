        This is a story of personal loss, identity, and Vietnam.
        </p>

        <p>
        Long before I was born, my parents abandoned their home country, family, and friends in hopes of a better future. A better future, not only for themselves but for the generation they would leave behind once they’re gone. They fled with no idea of where they would end up. All they wanted was better opportunities. Opportunities which did not exist in Vietnam. Permanence was a feeling they wouldn’t be feeling for a long time. They were without a home for years before they arrived in Sweden. 
        </p>

        <p>
        Growing up in Sweden, I never had a sense of belonging. I was not quite Swedish enough to be celebrating Christmas, not Vietnamese enough for Tết. I had to forge my own identity. In a society that’s built on a consensus culture, where groupthink is law, I had to find my own truth. As a kid, I never knew why I felt sad after every visit to Vietnam. What was the emptiness that I felt? Now that I am older I realize it was the people, the culture, and the love I experienced in Vietnam that always made me at ease. It felt like home.
        </p>

        <p>
        I still remember the time during my young adulthood where I returned to Vietnam after having not visited for ten years. For every year that had passed, I had become more distant and the sense of familiarity had faded. Vietnam is a beautiful country. I had forgotten the feeling of sitting on a street corner, enjoying a fresh bowl of Bún bò Huế. I had forgotten how the sound of motorbikes and chatter made me feel alive. Going back to Huế, where my grandma lives, brought me back in time. Where life was so simple. I would walk around and see the villagers go about their daily lives, free from all modern worries. The dinners together with the villagers at night gave me a sense of joy.  The conversation had their full undivided attention. Where the experience in and of itself was the focus. There was no worry about the future. We were living in the moment. We were present. 
        </p>

        <p>
        Going back after such a long period of time, I realized I had lost parts of myself as the years had passed. I had lost the language, but more importantly, I had lost the connection to people who I once was close to. What hurt me the most was my inability to communicate with people I cared about. So what do we do when our words fail us and we lose ourselves? When the very people we want close to us feel the most distant? 
        </p>

        <p>
        For the last few years, I have been trying to learn more about the culture and people. To understand my relatives, to understand my parent’s history and culture, to understand myself, I needed to learn the language. Languages shape the way we think. Each language has its own worldview, built by our ancestors and those before them. When you learn a new language you give yourself the ability to look at the world through a new lens. You unravel a world which you have not yet explored. Language constructs reality, and, in turn, helps us understand the very essence of what makes us human.
        </p>

        <p>
        My parents fled Vietnam in hopes of a better future for their children. They understood everything that would be lost along the way: traditions would be destroyed, languages forgotten, and connections would be broken. They understood that their children would grow up having to find their own identity. 
        </p>

        <p>
        Their children begin a quest to discover their heritage. They know it will be a long and difficult journey. They know they will feel lost along the way. They will bear the weight of two worlds. There will be times where they want to give up, times where they will be asked: "Where are you from?", no matter which of the two places they are at.
        </p>

        <p>
        What people don't realize that this is a struggle shared by many throughout their lives but it’s all concealed behind a veneer of honor and pride. We are told by our parents not to show our weakness. Don’t let the world know of our struggles. Bear it all by ourselves. Be invisible. Even to ourselves. That was the way we were raised. With this story, I want to share to shed light on something that is not often spoken of. It's not a special story. It's just real.
