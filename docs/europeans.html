          Every culture has a myth of decline from some golden age, and almost
          all peoples throughout history have been pessimists. Even today
          pessimism still dominates huge parts of the world. An indefinite
          pessimist looks out onto a bleak future, but he has no idea what to do
          about it. This describes Europe since the early 1970s, when the
          continent succumbed to undirected bureaucratic drift. Today the whole
          Eurozone is in slow-motion crisis, and nobody is in charge. The
          European Central Bank doesn’t stand for anything but improvisation:
          the U.S. Treasury prints “In God We Trust” on the dollar; the ECB
          might as well print “Kick the Can Down the Road” on the euro.
          Europeans just react to events as they happen and hope things don’t
          get worse. The indefinite pessimist can’t know whether the inevitable
          decline will be fast or slow, catastrophic or gradual. All he can do
          is wait for it to happen, so he might as well eat, drink, and be merry
          in the meantime: hence Europe’s famous vacation mania
