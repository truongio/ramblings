        <p>
          When we first met, I was a dreamer.
        </p>
        <p>

          I dreamt of worlds, peoples, stories oceans away. Galaxies away perhaps.
        </p>
          <p>
            I dreamt that one day, after traversing these oceans and galaxies, I would find a soul who would ignite a blaze within mine.
          </p>

          <p>
          <p>
            This dream kept me awake night after night, following me like a ghost trailing a lonesome traveler.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was a dream that clawed its way to the forefront of my daily thought. Midday meditation soon gave way to haphazard daydreams.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then, as always, high tide came ‘round and swept me off. Away into an ocean of longing.
          </p>
          <p>
            And I found myself navigating uncharted waters with no compass in hand.
          </p>
          <hr>
          <p>
            When we last met, I was a dreamer still.
          </p>
          <p>
            Stubborn, forlorn, hopeless.
          </p>
          <p>I wanted you to be an anchor, keeping me afloat and still.</p>
          <p>I wanted you to be a lighthouse, an indicator that, at long last, I had reached shore.</p>
          <p>
            I wanted you to be a seaside cottage, a home in which I found respite. I would spend my days in your shelter, and in the embrace of the ocean breeze.
          </p>
          <p>
            Instead, you appeared as a buoy. Adrift at sea, albeit more anchored than most.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nevertheless, nothing more than mile marker in this journey of mine with no end in sight.
          </p>
          <hr>
          <p>
            This dream, I now ask myself, at what point will it end? When will I wake from slumber? Did I perhaps forget to set my alarm?
          </p>
          <p>
            This ocean between us — whoever you are — its waves crash with good intentions. But a storm is still a storm, and I wonder now if it will ever pass.
          </p>
          <p>
            I dream of you — wherever you are — and I hope that you are happy. I hope the shore on your side of the sea makes you feel alive. And I hope that you, too, find your seaside cottage and that it will shelter you from storms still to come.
          </p>
          <p>
            And I,
          </p>
          <p>
            I will remain the drunken sailor,
          </p>
          <p>
            weaving poems and daydreams,
          </p>
          <p>
            lost at sea.
          </p>
